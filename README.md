This is a new site dedicated to My profile. 
This page is created as a challenge to demostrate what I have learnt so far. This challenge is to recreate a mock up project. 
There were alot of challenges which I faced during this challenge for example implementing the css grid which would have been perfect to create the mock up page perfectly. 

I was unable to complete complete the media queries either. This challenge has identified where i am currently struggling and needing extra work and support. 

I have learnt how to use CSS flexbox, continuous usage of github, creating and cloning repository for new projects in order to deploy it. 

I have utilised images from unsplash website for this project.
